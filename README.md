### Card Emoji Setup (For displaying cards in Discord)

3. Upload all images from the `split_deck_images` folder as custom emojis in this server.
4. Get each emojiâ€™s unique identifier:
    - Open `bot/card_display.py` and find the emoji dictionary.
    - In Discord, type each emoji (e.g., `:ace_of_spades:`) to see its identifier, or use a Discord utility bot to fetch emoji IDs.
5. Update the emoji dictionary in `bot/card_display.py` with the correct emoji IDs from your server.
