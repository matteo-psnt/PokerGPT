## Setup

To set up the Poker Discord Bot in your Discord server, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Discord application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Generate a bot token for your application.
3. Invite the bot to your server using the generated invite link.
4. Create a copy of the `.env_template` file and change the name to `.env`.
5. In the `.env` file, replace the api keys with your own:

```plaintext
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

6. Replace `your_discord_bot_token` with your Discord bot token.
7. Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your OpenAI API key.
8. (Optional) If you want to change the model used, open the `run_bot.py` file and update the model_name variable.
9. Run the bot script on your preferred hosting environment.
10. To host the card images, create a new Discord server.
11. Add the bot to the server where you want to host the images.
12. In the server where the bot is hosted, import all the images in the `split_deck_images` folder as emojis.
13. Open the `bot/card_display.py` file and copy its contents.
14. Paste the copied text into a Discord channel to obtain a unique identifier for each emoji.
15. Replace the unique identifiers in the dictionary within the `bot/card_display.py` file.
16. To verify proper functionality, check on a separate Discord server if the emojis are working correctly.

### Optional Database Setup

If you want to utilize the database features:

1. Set up a MySQL server. If you don't have one, you can use services like [MySQL on AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/) or [MySQL on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/mysql/).
2. Once your MySQL server is set up, execute the commands from the `db/database.sql` file to create the necessary database and tables.

3. In the `.env` file, uncomment (remove the `#` markers) and fill in the database configuration section:

```plaintext
DB_HOST=your_database_host
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_NAME=pokerGPTdatabase
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual database details.
